Power is money. Nobody knows the extent of Weyland Consortium’s control, but they always make a profit. The world’s largest conglomerate, they own—visibly, and invisibly—hundreds of megacorps. Banking, security, arms, mining, construction—all are within their remit. No matter the situation, Weyland comes out on top.\\nRising beyond the Earth’s atmosphere, the Space Elevator known as “The Beanstalk” has enabled Weyland’s influence to extend beyond the global, to the orbital, the lunar. The future of humanity is in the stars and Weyland will stop at nothing to get there.\\nEnemies of the Consortium, and there are many, rarely last long. Buildings collapse. Drone strikes go awry. Bodies are found with bullets in their heads. Yet the blame is never theirs, because they were never there. Black ops agents and PR teams ensure that. They exist in the shadows, pulling the strings to ensure their vision of the world is never compromised.\",\n      \"is_mini\": false,\n      \"side_id\": \"corp\",\n      \"updated_at\": \"2022-10-24T14:31:53.706Z\"\n    },\n    \"relationships\": {\n      \"side\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": \"http://api-preview.netrunnerdb.com/api/v3/public/factions/weyland_consortium/relationships/side\",\n          \"related\": \"http://api-preview.netrunnerdb.com/api/v3/public/factions/weyland_consortium/side\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"cards\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": \"http://api-preview.netrunnerdb.com/api/v3/public/factions/weyland_consortium/relationships/cards\",\n          \"related\": \"http://api-preview.netrunnerdb.com/api/v3/public/factions/weyland_consortium/cards\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"printings\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": \"http://api-preview.netrunnerdb.com/api/v3/public/factions/weyland_consortium/relationships/printings\",\n          \"related\": \"http://api-preview.netrunnerdb.com/api/v3/public/factions/weyland_consortium/printings\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}",
